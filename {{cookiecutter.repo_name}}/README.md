## Requirements:

- Node 6.3.x
- nvm

## Installation

```
$ nvm install
$ npm install
```

## Quick Start

```
$ nvm use
$ npm run dev
```

## Usage

First, install your dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start a Browsersync server and watch files for development:

```
npm run dev
```

or to build, cachebust, and minify all assets for production:

```
npm run build
```

You can also optimize PNG and JPEG images using [tinify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinify):

```
npm run tinify
```

## Configuration

[nconf](https://github.com/indexzero/nconf) is used to handle configuration which lives in `config.js`.

All configuration variables should be defined in the `nconf.defaults` and it should be indicated if they are required.

The configuration is passed to [envyify](https://github.com/zertosh/loose-envify) for transforming with browserify. This
means you can use `process.env.FOO` in your browserified JavaScript files and the appropriate environment variable
will be substituted during the build process to be shipped in the browser.

__🔐 TIP:__ Don't leak secret keys, neither by commmitting them nor by passing them to browserify. If the var you are
using should be kept secret, you should not add it to `config.js`.


__⏱ TIP:__ If the config var is an amount of time, specify the units in the var name:

```
nconf.defaults({
  TIMEOUT_MS: 2000,
  EXPIRATION_S: 3
})
```

## ESlint

[ESlint](http://eslint.org/) is used for static analysis of JavaScript files. By default,
the `.eslintrc` is configured to extend [Airbnb's base](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb#eslint-config-airbnbbase) configuration,
with a few small modifications:

* 2 spaces for indentation.
* No semicolons.
* Only single quotes.
* Unix linebreaks.

If you use global variables that are already defined in the DOM, add them to the `globals` object
in the `.eslintrc` to [register them](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#specifying-globals) with the linter.

## Stylelint

[Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) is used for static analysis of SASS files. By default,
the `.stylelintrc` is configured to extend [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard)
and uses [stylelint-selector-bem-pattern](https://github.com/davidtheclark/stylelint-selector-bem-pattern),
with a few small modifications:

* 4 spaces for indentation.
* Only single quotes.
* No vendor prefixes (autoprefixer is preferred).
* Max of 2 adjacent empty lines.
* Required empty line between nested selectors, except first nested.
* No [browser hacks](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/tree/master/src/rules/no-browser-hacks).
* No [unsupported browser features](http://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/no-unsupported-browser-features/).
