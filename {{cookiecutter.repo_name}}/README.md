## Requirements:

- Node 6.10.x
- nvm

## Installation

```
$ nvm install
$ yarn
```

## Quick Start

```
$ nvm use
$ npm run dev
```

## Usage
First, install your dependencies, there is a `yarn.lock` file, make sure you have yarn installed globally:

```
yarn
```

To start a hot reload dev server and watch files for development:

```
npm run dev
```

or to build, cachebust, and minify all assets for production:

```
npm run build
```

You can also optimize PNG and JPEG images using [tinify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinify):

```
npm run tinify
```

## SUIT CSS
mo-static relies on [SUIT CSS](https://suitcss.github.io/) to package it's css but it does more than just that. Suit comes with a bunch of CSS packages such as a grid and buttons. It also ships with a whole bunch of utilities for text positioning, visibility and positioning. All of these components and utils are included by default since we import suit completely in `app.css`. Some useful docs of utilities and components include:
- [Grid component](https://github.com/suitcss/components-grid/)
- [Button component](https://github.com/suitcss/components-button/)
- [Text utilities (alignment, truncation, line breaks) ](https://github.com/suitcss/utils-text)
- [Display utilities (block, inline, hidden)](https://github.com/suitcss/utils-display)
- [Position utilities (relative, absolute, full screen](https://github.com/suitcss/utils-position)

A list with all utilities can be found [here](https://github.com/suitcss/utils) and a list with all components can be found [here](https://github.com/suitcss/components)

## Configuration
[convict](https://github.com/mozilla/node-convict) is used to handle configuration which lives in `config.js`.

The convict instance just holds a javascript object. In there you can define all variables you like. If they have an `env` key the default value will be overwritten if the value is present in the environment variables. If you want to be even more specific with values only being present in some environments you can uncomment these lines and create the appropriate files:
```javascript
// var env = config.get('env');
// config.loadFile('./config/' + env + '.json');
```

`gulp-nunjucks` automatically passes all this data when it compiles your HTML. This means you can just output `{{ secretMessage }}` within your HTML and the compiler will replace it with whatever value you have in convict.

As for the JS you need to explicitely indicate which values you want passed to your code via webpack to prevent passing any sensitive data. You can do so by modifying the `webpack.config.js` file, we use the `DefinePlugin` to make our environment variables available in our code. This means you can use `process.env.SECRET_MESSAGE` in your Javascript files and the appropriate environment variable will be substituted during the build process to be shipped in the browser.

__üîê TIP:__ Don't leak secret keys, neither by commmitting them nor by passing them to your JS. If the var you are
using should be kept secret, you should not add it to `config.js`.


## Standard
[Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) is used for static analysis of JavaScript files. Standard, compared to ESlint allows/needs no configuration, if you really need to suppress a warning you can take a look [here](https://github.com/feross/standard#how-do-i-hide-a-certain-warning).

## Stylelint
[Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) is used for static analysis of css files. There is a suitcss config installed for Stylelint. All configuration lives in `stylelint.config.js` , it exports a object that can be passed to the suitcss preprocessor in `build.js` and be used when running `npm run lint`
